Hello Ubisoft Barcelona,

My name is Meine Zeinstra. I'm a passionate programmer from The Netherlands with a passion for Game Engine/Tools programming, currently studying International Game Architecture and Design at Breda University of Applied Sciences.

My passion to create games started all the way back when I was creating levels in Far Cry 2. Since then, I've always wanted to start programming games. The last 6-7 years I've been focussing on game programming at several educations, continuously looking to work on architectures and tools in languages like C++. I've always focussed on engine/tools programming. Though, I also took the role of gameplay, QA, and AI programmer in a couple of projects. 

At this moment, I feel like I'm done with the exercises from schools and ready to get a taste from the game industry. I would love to work as an engine/tools programmer and what better way is there to start at one of the biggest AAA game companies in the game industry.

Because of Peter van Dranen (a Game Design Lecturer at our school), I found out that you are still looking for an Engine Programmer. I'm hoping to get a chance to fulfill this role as an intern at Ubisoft which would start in September and lasts half a year or full academic year, depending on what's the preferred length or usual length for you.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,


Meine Zeinstra

Hello Yager,

My name is Meine Zeinstra. I'm a passionate programmer from The Netherlands with a passion for Game Engine/Tools programming, currently studying International Game Architecture and Design at Breda University of Applied Sciences.

My passion to create games started when I was creating levels in several games like Far Cry and some web applications. The last 6-7 years I've been focussing on game programming at several educations, continuously looking to work on architectures and tools in languages like C++. I've always focussed on engine/tools programming. Though, I also took the role of gameplay, QA, and AI programmer in a couple of projects. 

At this moment, I feel like I'm done with the exercises from schools and ready to get a taste from the game industry. I would love to work as a tools programmer and what better way is there to start a rising game company in the game industry like Yager.

Because of your visit at Breda University of Applied Sciences, I figured you have a great work atmosphere. I found out that you are looking for a Tools Programmer and I'm hoping to get a chance to fulfill this role as an intern at Yager which would start in September and lasts half a year or full academic year, depending on what's the preferred or usual length for you.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Mandates: 
shared tech lead 2 engines. 
     Constantly important decisions, code reviews. 
     Most importantly graphics programmers decisions as 
      they constantly want to up the graphics even though there's a lot 
      to improve on current implementations and overscope the project.

Epic fail/challenge:
2 engines in Breda (C++). 
	Before that, engine in Java 
		(input, 
		output (audio), 
		scenegraph, 
		UI). 
	Regret Java (garbage collection). 
	 Not sure if it's Java or yourself.
	FPS engine
	 Didnt care about result (transforms/scenegraph)


Challenge:
Obviously a lot, constant (schools)
	Maya plugin
	  Inconsistent API
	Team work
	  passive
	  not motivated
	Social
	Control freak

Outside:
	Soccer
	Parties / drniking
	Hanging ut with friends
	Rocketleague
	Personal projects

Ask back:
	Team building?
	  LAN parties

Passions/quailties:
	Love to work on core (things that litterally build the game)
	Because of core:
	  Learn more about (low-level) C++, APIs libraries, scripting languages etc
	Always supportive (also outside of projects)
	  Aka tools
	Flexible (experience with different carreers)
	  game and web (own comapny). Working on a project
