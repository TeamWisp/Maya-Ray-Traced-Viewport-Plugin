Your device doesn't seem to support DXR (the official DirectX Ray Tracing API).

This could have several reasons:
    1) Wrong SDK version. (Required: `Windows 10 October 2018 Update SDK (17763)`)
    2) Wrong OS version. (Required: 1809 (17763.107))
    3) DX12 GPU with a incompatible DirectX Raytracing driver. (NVIDIA: driver version 415 or higher, AMD: Consult Vendor for availability)

If you still want to continue this action, try to open the Real-Time Final Render Preview render mode again.
BE AWARE! Because DXR is not supported, it is using a quite unstable Fallback API. This may crash Maya and you may lose your work! Be sure to save your work before you continue!
